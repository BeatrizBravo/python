badgers are short-legged omnivores in the family mustelidae (which also includes the otters, wolverines, martens, minks, polecats, weasels, and ferrets). badgers are a polyphyletic rather than a natural taxonomic grouping, being united by their squat bodies and adaptions for fossorial activity. all belong to the caniform suborder of carnivoran mammals. the fifteen species of mustelid badgers are grouped in four subfamilies.
