In this project you'll use Python to do very basic data analysis on a spreadsheet.

The standard project will use csv file that contains fake sales data.

The csv file for the standard project is called sales.csv and is included with your course materials.
Please ask your instructor in case you are unable to find it.
You will not need any additional knowledge beyond what is covered in this course to complete this project.

# Required Tasks
    1. Read the data from the spreadsheet
    2. Collect all of the sales from each month into a single list
    3. Output the total sales across all months


# Ideas for Extending the Project
    ● Output a summary of the results to a spreadsheet
    ● Calculate the following:
        ○ Monthly changes as a percentage
        ○ The average
        ○ Months with the highest and lowest sales
    ● Use a data source from a different spreadsheet (see Useful Resources)
