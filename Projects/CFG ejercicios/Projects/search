Project Brief: Search
In this project you'll create a program to search for recipes based on an ingredient.
The standard project uses the Edamam Recipe API, but can be changed to use a different API after completing the required tasks.
You will not need any additional knowledge beyond what is covered in this course to complete this project.

#Setup
To use the Edamam API you will need to register for an account.
    In your Edamam account dashboard you can find an Application ID and Application Key, which you will need to make requests to the API.
To make a request to the Edamam API use the following URL:
    https://api.edamam.com/search?q={INGREDIENT}&app_id={YOUR_APP_KEY}&app_key={YOUR_ APP_KEY}


For example,
    if the App ID and App Key for me account were “ch37j44” and “a58hia”
    I wanted to search for “cheese”, the url would look like this:
        https://api.edamam.com/search?q=cheese&app_id=ch37j44&app_key=a58hia


# Required Tasks
1. Read the Edamam API documentation ★https://developer.edamam.com/edamam-docs-recipe-api
2. Ask the user to enter an ingredient that they want to search for
3. Create a function that makes a request to the Edamam API with the required ingredient as part of the search query (also included your Application ID and Application Key 4. Get the returned recipes from the API response
5. Display the recipes for each search result

Ideas for Extending the Project:
    - Save the results to a file
    - Order the results by weight or another piece of data
    - Ask the user additional questions to decide which recipe they should choose ● Cross-reference the ingredient against the Edamam nutrition analysis API ● Use a different searchable API (suggestions in useful resources)
