In this space, I will be working on various mini-projects to learn and develop my skills in Python. 
## Play with me:
### Opcion A
1. Press the key "." (full stop) and enter. 
2. Wait for it to load and Continue "Working in Github Codespaces" and set with the first option
3. Open the terminal with Ctrl+Shift+' or go to the top right, where are the 3 lines (hamburger), select Terminal -->  new terminal.
4. List the files and folder in the repository,
    ```bash

5. Change directory to the right game, example:
    ```bash
    cd 'Guess the number'
    ```

    @BeatrizBravo ➜ /workspaces/python (main) $ cd 'Guess the number'
    @BeatrizBravo ➜ /workspaces/python/Guess the number (main) $ ls
    guessNumber-byComputer.py  guessNumber-game
    ```
6. Run python with the specific game:
    ```bash
    python guessNumber-game
    ```
   
    ```bash
    Example:
    @BeatrizBravo ➜ /workspaces/python/Guess the number (main) $ python guessNumber-game
